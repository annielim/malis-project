As we have seen before, even with the implementation of the originak MALIS
paper~\cite{turaga_maximin_2009} we were able to get promising results on both
the CREMI and ISBI datasets.  We were also able to see that the method was greatly
improved in~\cite{funke_large_2019} and this will be the goal that we aim to
reach for the coming semester.\\
We were able to work great as a team and hope that with RaphaÃ«l joining us for
this semester we will be able to produce even better results. We also hope that
we will be able to apply the methods to other segmentation tasks, such as the BSDS500 dataset.

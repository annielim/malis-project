As we have seen before, even with the implementation of the original MALIS
paper~\cite{turaga_maximin_2009} we were able to get promising results on both
the CREMI and ISBI datasets. \\
We were also able to see that the method was greatly improved
in~\cite{funke_large_2019} and implementing all the improvements gave us
better results on the CREMI dataset, which shows how effective this method
is.\\
Although our results are not state of the art, our implementation is complete
enough that it can serve as a reference open-source implementation in Pytorch
for future experiments, as there are still a lot of experiments that can be
done with this method.\\

We would like to thank Laurent Najman for supervising us during this project
and for his guidance through every step of the project.

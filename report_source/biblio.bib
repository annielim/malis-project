	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10566},
	abstract = {We study the problem of fitting an ultrametric distance to a dissimilarity graph in the context of hierarchical cluster analysis. Standard hierarchical clustering methods are specified procedurally, rather than in terms of the cost function to be optimized. We aim to overcome this limitation by presenting a general optimization framework for ultrametric fitting. Our approach consists of modeling the latter as a constrained optimization problem over the continuous space of ultrametrics. So doing, we can leverage the simple, yet effective, idea of replacing the ultrametric constraint with a min-max operation injected directly into the cost function. The proposed reformulation leads to an unconstrained optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by gradient descent methods. The flexibility of our framework allows us to investigate several cost functions, following the classic paradigm of combining a data fidelity term with a regularization. While we provide no theoretical guarantee to find the global optimum, the numerical results obtained over a number of synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the good performance of our approach with respect to state-of-the-art agglomerative algorithms. This makes us believe that the proposed framework sheds new light on the way to design a new generation of hierarchical clustering methods. Our code is made publicly available at {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/PerretB/ultrametric-fitting\}.},

	abstract = {Watershed technique from mathematical morphology (MM) is one of the most widely used operators for image segmentation. Recently watersheds are adapted to edge weighted graphs, allowing for wider applicability. However, a few questions remain to be answered - (a) How do the boundaries of the watershed operator behave? (b) Which loss function does the watershed operator optimize? (c) How does watershed operator relate with existing ideas from machine learning. In this article, a framework is developed, which allows one to answer these questions. This is achieved by generalizing the maximum margin principle to maximum margin partition and proposing a generic solution, MORPHMEDIAN, resulting in the maximum margin principle. It is then shown that watersheds form a particular class of MORPHMEDIAN classiﬁers. Using the ensemble technique, watersheds are also extended to ensemble watersheds. These techniques are compared with relevant methods from literature and it is shown that watersheds perform better than SVM on some datasets, and ensemble watersheds usually outperform random forest classiﬁers.},

	abstract = {We present a method combining affinity prediction with region agglomeration, which improves significantly upon the state of the art of neuron segmentation from electron microscopy (EM) in accuracy and scalability. Our method consists of a 3D U-Net, trained to predict affinities between voxels, followed by iterative region agglomeration. We train using a structured loss based on Malis, encouraging topologically correct segmentations obtained from affinity thresholding. Our extension consists of two parts: First, we present a quasi-linear method to compute the loss gradient, improving over the original quadratic algorithm. Second, we compute the gradient in two separate passes to avoid spurious gradient contributions in early training stages. Our predictions are accurate enough that simple learning-free percentile-based agglomeration outperforms more involved methods used earlier on inferior predictions. We present results on three diverse EM datasets, achieving relative improvements over previous results of 27, 15, and 250 percent. Our findings suggest that a single method can be applied to both nearly isotropic block-face EM data and anisotropic serial sectioned EM data. The runtime of our method scales linearly with the size of the volume and achieves a throughput of 2.6 seconds per megavoxel, qualifying our method for the processing of very large datasets.},

	abstract = {Images can be segmented by first using a classifier to predict an affinity graph that reflects the degree to which image pixels must be grouped together and then partitioning the graph to yield a segmentation. Machine learning has been applied to the affinity classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassification rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the affinity graph. We present the first machine learning algorithm for training a classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classification of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of finding the connected components of the thresholded affinity graph, we are able to train an affinity classifier to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning. Our learning algorithm corresponds to the learning of maximin affinities between image pixel pairs, which are predictive of the pixel-pair connectivity.},

	title = {Learning image segmentation and hierarchies by learning ultrametric distances},
	abstract = {Thesis (Ph. D.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, 2009. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. Includes bibliographical references (p. 100-105). In this thesis I present new contributions to the fields of neuroscience and computer science. The neuroscientific contribution is a new technique for automatically reconstructing complete neural networks from densely stained 3d electron micrographs of brain tissue. The computer science contribution is a new machine learning method for image segmentation and the development of a new theory for supervised hierarchy learning based on ultrametric distance functions. It is well-known that the connectivity of neural networks in the brain can have a dramatic influence on their computational function . However, our understanding of the complete connectivity of neural circuits has been quite impoverished due to our inability to image all the connections between all the neurons in biological network. Connectomics is an emerging field in neuroscience that aims to revolutionize our understanding of the function of neural circuits by imaging and reconstructing entire neural circuits. In this thesis, I present an automated method for reconstructing neural circuitry from 3d electron micrographs of brain tissue. The cortical column, a basic unit of cortical microcircuitry, will produce a single 3d electron micrograph measuring many 100s terabytes once imaged and contain neurites from well over 100,000 different neurons. It is estimated that tracing the neurites in such a volume by hand would take several thousand human years. Automated circuit tracing methods are thus crucial to the success of connectomics. In computer vision, the circuit reconstruction problem of tracing neurites is known as image segmentation. Segmentation is a grouping problem where image pixels belonging to the same neurite are clustered together. While many algorithms for image segmentation exist, few have parameters that can be optimized using groundtruth data to extract maximum performance on a specialized dataset. In this thesis, I present the first machine learning method to directly minimize an image segmentation error. It is based the theory of ultrametric distances and hierarchical clustering. Image segmentation is posed as the problem of learning and classifying ultrametric distances between image pixels. Ultrametric distances on point set have the special property that (cont.) they correspond exactly to hierarchical clustering of the set. This special property implies hierarchical clustering can be learned by directly learning ultrametric distances. In this thesis, I develop convolutional networks as a machine learning architecture for image processing. I use this powerful pattern recognition architecture with many tens of thousands of free parameters for predicting affinity graphs and detecting object boundaries in images. When trained using ultrametric learning, the convolutional network based algorithm yields an extremely efficient linear-time segmentation algorithm. In this thesis, I develop methods for assessing the quality of image segmentations produced by manual human efforts or by automated computer algorithms. These methods are crucial for comparing the performance of different segmentation methods and is used through out the thesis to demonstrate the quality of the reconstructions generated by the methods in this thesis. by Srinivas C.

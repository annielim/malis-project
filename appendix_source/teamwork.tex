\subsection{Team organization}
The context of this project is somewhat special because with quarantine we have never seen each other face to face. Knowing that Maxime B. and Maxime S. had no knowledge of the project, we had to make many calls so that Josselin explained the content of the papers as well as the work carried out.
The recording of the presentation as well as the previous report were good supports to facilitate the handling of the project.\\

The organization is the same as that of the previous group: we have set personal goals listed in a document, and we have a meeting per week with our supervisor.\\

We finally had only a short time to carry out our objectives because they took time for new entrants to be comfortable with the project and of course the training time is very long with volumes.

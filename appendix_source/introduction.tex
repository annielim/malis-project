In this appendix you will find the continuation of the work carried out for the first report. The main task was to adapt the algorithms and the architecture of the network to process 3D images. This in order to know if training with volumes allows obtaining higher scores than those obtained with training according to two dimensions.\\

Here, we will detail our implementation of the 3D architecture used in \cite{funke_large_2019}, some experiments and the various observations that we were able to make during the training of the neural network.

Our work also focused on the post processing proposed by the paper that we had achieved only a naive implementation.\\
Training is always carried out with the Cremi dataset and it should be noted that we did not have much training time and the affinities are not as good as the previous report.

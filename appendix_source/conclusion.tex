As we have seen, we have been able to obtain promising results by working on the architecture of the neuron network. However the results of our implementation of the 3D architecture is quite disappointing due to the problems we encountered and the short training time that we were able to do.\\

There is still a lot of experiments to do as much on training as on post-processing. The question of the importance of the agglomeration of regions in terms of numerical results remains pending. Moreover the previous group was able to apply MALIS to another type of image with BSDS500 using the implementation of \cite{turaga_maximin_2009} but we did not have time to do it with the improved method.\\

We  would  like  to  thank  Laurent  Najman  for  supervising  us  during  this  project.
